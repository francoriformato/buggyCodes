# buggyCodes
Project under development for Web Technologies course, attended at University of Naples "Parthenope".

14 May 2021 : PWA available at https://buggycodes.games/ , installable on both mobile and desktop. Still in early stage.
              Website / PWA hosted on DigitalOcean, with an Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64 droplet and nginx.

25 May 2021 : Converted buggyCodes in a nodeJS app.
              Actually, this is the overall diagram of the PWA.

              To Do's:
              1) Develop more content for the game;
              2) Add more data to the user model (used in mongoDB): more optional fields?;
              3) Find a way to show a programming fact on the dashboard;
              4) A function to show news on the news page from an external file;
              5) Graph.JS to show a graph about the current week in the application;
              6) Decide what to show on the profile page: stats about the exercises done?;
