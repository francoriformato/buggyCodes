# buggyCodes
Project under development for Web Technologies course, attended at University of Naples "Parthenope".

14 May 2021 : PWA available at https://buggycodes.games/ , installable on both mobile and desktop. Still in early stage.
              Website / PWA hosted on DigitalOcean, with an Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64 droplet and nginx.

25 May 2021 : Converted buggyCodes in a nodeJS app.
              Actually, this is the overall diagram of the PWA.
