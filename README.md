# buggyCodes
#### A new way to learn programming through bugs

buggyCodes is a project developed for a modern Web Technologies course, attended at University of Naples "Parthenope". 
A demo of the project and a video has been presented at the Hackathon "Gamification in Programming Education".

[Features] Video shown at the Hackathon: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4chRgkImtuY&ab_channel=FrancoRiformato"> Introducing buggyCodes </a>

Live demo: <a href="https://buggycodes.games/"> buggyCodes </a>

[Techical Aspects] Presentation for the exam [14/06/2021] :

# Features
The main features meaningful for the Web Technologies course developed for buggyCodes are:

*Client-Side*
- **Responsiveness**, to provide usability between desktop and mobile devices, archived with Bootstrap;
- **Installability**, so it's required that the project is actually a **PWA**, installable on smartphones and PCs, archived with a service worker and a manifest;
- Usage of the **AJAX** methodology (with **jQuery**, to have an API that can work on most browsers), to load data dynamically on a page without having to reload the page again;

*Server Side*
- **Hosted** on a DigitalOcean Droplet with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS;
- **Domain provider**: name.com, with DigitalOcean's DNS;
- **SSL Certificate**: Lets Encrypt
- **Web server**: nginx, that acts also as a reverse proxy to forward the traffic to nodeJS;
- Actual application's **routes** managed through nodeJS & Express, with EJS as the rendering engine;
- **noSQL database**: mongoDB Atlas;

Here is a diagram of the overall structure of the application:

Initial project presentation: 03/05/2021

Agreed upon receipt of 21/05/2021:
- Usage of nginx as web server & reverse proxy;
- Usage of mongoDB instead of mySQL;
- Usage of nodeJS instead of Flask.

+ Focus on the web technologies used instead of the game in the application.

### How to test buggyCodes?
----

> Method #1: Visiting https://buggycodes.games/

In this way, it's required just to visit the page via a common web browser.
The website will stay online from the date of delivery of the project.
It will be online thanks to the usage of pm2 (a production process manager for nodeJS) running on my DigitalOcean Droplet.
The database will be populated to test functionality like the user's motto and the online leaderboard.

> Method #2: Setting up a nodeJS server

To test the project in this way, it's required to have nodeJS installed on your own machine and run it.
With this method, the SSL certificate may not work, so the PWA functionality may be broken.
Please note that a nodeJS server is required to load the dependencies explained later and to load the game content.
Running the project directly via Chrome will also result in the impossibility to load the game (it has to load multiple files and assets and this is forbidded by the default behaviour of the browser to avoid security risks).

### Elements Explanation
----
> Why a DigitalOcean Droplet?

A droplet provide great flexibility and it's fast to deploy. Thanks to GitHub for Students, with 100$ of credits on DigitalOcean, I had the opportunity to use this technology and to quickly test my website. To easily upload changes to the droplet, I used ssh to log into it.

> Why an SSL certificate is required?

An SSL certificate is required to provide https traffic in my website. HTTPS is also needed to better suffice to the requisites of a PWA.

> What package are used in nodeJS?

It's required to have Express, Mongoose, Passport, bodyParser.
Some other dependencies are: nicejob, devquote & bad-words.
Express is a lightweight framework to provide multiple utilities. In particular, Router is really useful to create custom user's routes.
Mongoose is used to establish a connection to my mongoDB Atlas Cluster.
Passport is required to implement the Google Strategy for Log-In.
bodyParser is useful to parse incoming request bodies and to use the req.body property (to read the result of forms, such as the ones found in the Profile Page).
NiceJob is used to generate a random phrase for the user, taking account of its progress in buggyCodes.
Devquote generates a random developer quote and its author.
Bad-Words is a profanity filter that prevents the user to insert a motto or a country with bad words in it. Every bad words is censored with asterisk.

> What is used to login to buggyCodes?

Actually, everyone can login securely to buggyCodes without having to worry about their personal data being leaked. buggyCodes use the Google Sign-In to let you access its content.
To archieve this purpose, I used Passport.JS with the Google Strategy. To improve security, my personal mongoDB URI, google.ClientID & google.ClientSecret are stored in an external file: keys.js.

> What is stored on mongoDB Atlas?

On mongoDB, there are the main user informations required to provide the main functionality of the web app.
In particular, we can see the User model here.
File: *models/User.js*

```javascript
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  googleId: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  displayName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  firstName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  lastName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  image: {
    type: String,
  },
  email:{
  type:String,
  required: true,
  },
  createdAt: {
   type: Date,
   default: Date.now,
  },
  motto:{
   type:String,
   default:'The greatest programmer',
    },
    country:{
   type:String,
   default: 'USA',
    },
    level:{
   type:Number,
   default: '1',
    },
    onlineAvatar:{
   type:String,
   default: 'av1',
    },
    ExercisesDone:{
        type:Number,
    	default: '0',
    },
    ProgrammingLogic:{
        type:Number,
    	default: '0',
    },
    Speed:{
        type:Number,
    	default: '0',
    },
    Creativity:{
        type:Number,
    	default: '0',
    },
})

```

The default values are actually used to not have empty fields when creating a new user through Google Sign-In.

### UI / UX on different devices

Images uploaded to show how the website is rendered on different devices.
The overall style of the application is defined to be as similar as possibile to a native application, to give more relevance to its installability as PWA.
Here are some screenshot taken on different platforms:

#### Routes
In this image gallery it's shown how the different routes are mapped to the various elements of the pages.
The routes are divided in three different .js files contained in /routes.

> Index.JS

Here we have routes to render the login page, the about page and the news page. Every page rendered through EJS.
In particular, every page receives parameters to know the userinfo.
While the login page receives ensureGuest, the other routes receive ensureAuth, to be sure that the user can't access the pages of the application without being logged in.

> Auth.JS

This file contains routes that connects to Passport to successfully redirect to the Dashboard page.
It also manages the Log-out of the user.

Auth.JS is also a middleware, in particular to define ensureAuth and ensureGuest.
ensureAuth is a function that acknowledge if the user is authenticated.

> OptionalsRoute.JS

Here I defined /add/motto that is linked to a button in the Profile Page. This route establish a connection to mongoDB to update the motto of the user (typed in the form in the profile page) in the DB. The old motto is shown in the placeholder of the form.
Here is the query used to archive this purpose, with the input of the user cleaned from eventual bad words:


     const bodyCall = req.body;
     	
     await User_model.findOneAndUpdate(
	{ email: req.user.email },
	{ motto: filter.clean(bodyCall.motto) },
	{ new: true }
				       );
				     											  );

The same has been done for /add/country, to let the user type its Country in the form and register it to mongoDB.
There is not a Country selector because it's open the possibility to write down fantasy countries in your profile.

/add/level is a route used for testing purpose.
In particular, is used to raise by 1 the userLevel.
This is required to test the AJAX functionalities of the profile page, that "unlocks" some avatars only when the user reach an established level in game.

/add/randomMotto is a funny route used to show another random motto on the profile page. It's a simple reload of the profile page.
In fact, in /profile, we have:
```
router.get("/profile",ensureAuth, async(req, res) => {

   	var query = await User_model.aggregate([
    					{ "$match": { "User_model.motto": { $ne: req.user.motto } } },
   					{ "$sample": { "size": 1 } },
					{ $project: { "motto": 1,  _id: 0 } }
				  ]).exec()

	var randomStringified = JSON.stringify(query);
	var editedMotto = randomStringified.slice(11, -3);
 
        res.render("profile",{userinfo:req.user, randomMotto: editedMotto})
});
```
This route permits to the profile page to access infos such as the basic user information (userinfo) and a randomMotto.
In particular, randomMotto is a random phrase associated to another user and requested with a mongoDB query.
The query randomizes which motto to show, so it will show a different one every time we reload the page.

Another interesting route is the one that takes place when accessing the Dashboard page.
In this route, we can see the call to "devquote" (a function used to show a random quote of a random developer) and to "nicejob" (a function that returns a nice phrase to the user, based on it's progress in buggyCodes).
First of all, we need to know if the user created the account just today or not and then - with a series of IF - we can manage to show the right phrase for him.
In this route, it's also managed the leaderboard shown in the Dashboard page: a query to mongoDB to know which users (firstName | email | level | onlineAvatar) have the highest levels.
At the end of the route, index.ejs (the Dashboard page) is rendered and it knows all the current user basic information, a quote from a developer and its author, the current online leaderboard and a phrase to indicate the current user's progress.

```
router.get("/log",ensureAuth, async(req,res)=>{
    var quote = devquote();
    var howIsGoing;


    var userDate = req.user.createdAt;
    let ts = Date.now();
    let date_ob = new Date(ts);
    let todayDate = date_ob.getDate();
    
  
    var rankSearch = await User_model.aggregate([
				{ $sort : { level: -1 } },
				{ $project: { "level": 1,  "email" : 1, "firstName" : 1, "onlineAvatar" : 1, _id: 1 } }
			       ]);


    if (userDate.getDate() == todayDate && req.user.ExercisesDone == 0) {
	howIsGoing = "You just registered today and didn't do any exercise.. Move on!";
    }

    if (userDate.getDate() == todayDate && req.user.ExercisesDone > 0) {
	howIsGoing = "You just registered today.. Anyway.. " + nicejob();
    }

    if (userDate.getDate() != todayDate && req.user.ExercisesDone == 0) {
	howIsGoing = nicejob.not();
    }

    if (userDate.getDate() != todayDate && req.user.ExercisesDone > 0) {
	howIsGoing = nicejob();
    }

    res.render('index',{userinfo:req.user, quoteMessage: quote.text, quoteAuthor: quote.author, onlineRanking: rankSearch, sentiment: howIsGoing})
})
```


/avatar is a route to update the user avatar.
This route get the avatarID (avid) from the avatars button in the Profile Page. Actually, I didn't wrote a route for every avatar but I used the query params provided by Express.
The call to this routes are:
"/avatar?avid=av1", "/avatar?avid=av2", ecc..
Thanks to those calls, it's possible to have a single route that manages every avatar change.
There is also a mongoDB query to update the user avatar that looks like this:
```
	const avid = req.query.avid;

	await User_model.findOneAndUpdate(
	{ email: req.user.email },
	{ onlineAvatar: avid },
	{ new: true }
																 );
```

/add/level is a route used for testing purpose. It just find the current user in mongoDB and then upgrades its level by one.
This route should be linked to in-game mechanics, but the game it's not part of the Web Technologies exam.

/add/stats is another route linked to buttons just for testing the graph in the Dashboard page. This route make use of express' query params and it's called with /add/stats?statistic=STATISTIC_NAME. The STATISTIC_NAME can be exercises, logic, speed or creativity. Those values are shown in a visual form thanks to the graph rendered in index.ejs.
By using this route, we can upgrade by one those stats and see the graph changing in the Dashboard page.
Of course, also this route should be linked to actions in game, but it's actually linked to the 4 buttons (one for each statistic) just to test its functionality.

### AJAX Methodology + jQuery

Some AJAX functionality implemented are:
- In index.ejs:
	```
    $(document).ready(function(){  
    $("#exercisesRow").load("ajax_exercises.txt");
    $("#overview").load("ajax_sentiment.txt");
	});
	```
This is required to load the exercises from a custom txt file, to have a way more easy updatability. 
In this way, it's easy to implement a button that refresh only the exercises row, without reloading the entire page.
More AJAX functionalities are linked to the update of the leaderboards or the update of the news.

### PWA functionalities

To archieve the purpose of having an installable web app, I used a service worker and a manifest files.

> service-worker.JS

The service worker caches the static content of the website, that will be available also offline, triggers the install event (to provoke an installation on the device in which the site is visited), an event to clean the outdated caches and a fetch event to retrieve the cache when required.

> manifest.JSON

The manifest file has the basic app information, like the name, the orientation of the display used in some devices, the theme color, the description of the PWA.
The collection of the favicons (stored in the folder "favicons") is loaded by site.webmanifest, generated by <a href="https://www.favicon-generator.org/"> Favicon Generator </a>.

For iOS, there are custom made splash screens in the folder "iOS_splashscreens".
